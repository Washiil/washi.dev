# Welcome to my Website!

I appreciate you stoping by, I'm excited to start sharing my coding projects and experiences. For as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by how things work, and coding became a perfect outlet for that curiosity. An app on my phone: I can clone it, A game on my laptop: I can decompile it, A new technology: I can learn it.
Hey everyone! I'm excited to start sharing my coding journey and projects here. For as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by how things work, and coding became the perfect outlet for that curiosity.

The thrill of solving problems with code became my passion. Whether it was figuring out a tricky algorithm or debugging a stubborn piece of code, I loved the challenge. And the best part? Seeing my creations come to life.

Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects, big and small. Some have been for fun, others have been for practical use. I've built Discord bots that have grown to serve over 100,000 users, learning a ton about scalability and user experience along the way. I've also developed smaller, more personal projects â€“ companion apps to streamline my workflow or automate tedious tasks. Each project has been a learning experience, pushing me to expand my knowledge and improve my skills.

Now, as a computer science student, I'm excited to deepen my understanding of the theoretical foundations of computer science while continuing to build and explore. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.

This blog is a place for me to share my experiences, projects, and insights. I want to document my journey, connect with other developers, and hopefully inspire others to pursue their passion for coding.
