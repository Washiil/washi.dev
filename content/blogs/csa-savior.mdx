<h1>CSA-Savior: Why?</h1>

As a programmer, I've always found myself drawn to the challenge of solving coding problems. Recently, I decided to tackle a collection of Java coding challenges, and as I worked through them, I realized I wanted a way to share my solutions and showcase my progress. That's how CSA-Savior came to life.

<br />
<br />I wanted something more than just a repository of code. I envisioned a dynamic web application
that would not only display my solutions but also provide a clean and engaging user experience.

<h3>The Vision</h3>

The core idea was to create a web platform that would seamlessly present my Java coding solutions. I wanted to leverage modern web technologies to build a fast, responsive, and visually appealing site. Furthermore, I wanted to focus on efficiency, and reduced page load times.

<h3>Key Technologies</h3>

<ul className="left-0 w-full">
  <li>**Next.js:** For server-side rendering and routing.</li>
  <li>**TypeScript:** For type safety and maintainability.</li>
  <li>**Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling.</li>
  <li>**GitHub API:** For dynamic content loading.</li>
  <li>**SVG:** For creating custom wave components.</li>
  <li>**GitHub Pages:** For simple and effective hosting.</li>
</ul>

This combination allowed me to build a robust and efficient web application with a focus on a great user experience.

<h3>GitHub API Integration and Dynamic Content Loading</h3>

To minimize page load times, I decided to load my coding solutions dynamically using the GitHub API. This approach ensured that users only downloaded the content they needed, resulting in a faster and smoother browsing experience. This also allowed me to keep my code in a centralized location that was easy to update.

<h3>The Wave Effect</h3>

One of the aspects of this project I'm most proud of is the custom wave component I created using SVGs. I wanted to add a dynamic and visually appealing element to the home screen, and SVGs provided the perfect solution. By manipulating SVG paths and animations, I was able to generate beautiful sweeping wave arrays that added a unique touch to the site. I focused on creating my own components, rather than using a large amount of external libraries.

<h3>SEO Optimization</h3>

To ensure that my project could reach a wider audience, I implemented basic SEO best practices. I created a `robots.txt` file to guide search engine crawlers and a `sitemap.xml` file to help them index my content effectively. I wanted to ensure that my project was discoverable and accessible to anyone interested in Java coding challenges.

<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Improvements</h3>

Building CSA-Savior was a valuable learning experience. I gained a deeper understanding of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind, and I honed my skills in API integration and custom component development. There are always areas for improvement:

- **Expanding Content:** Adding more coding challenges and solutions.
- **Interactive Elements:** Implementing interactive elements to allow users to test and modify code snippets.
- **Enhanced SEO:** Further optimizing the site for search engines.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

CSA-Savior now gets ~15k views bi-weekly and had grown into something I am truly proud of. Starting from a small little repository of folders and growing into a modern website.
