# AOC Solutions

This project presents my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, solved entirely in Rust. The primary motivation was to rigorously explore and demonstrate Rust's performance characteristics, alongside the development of a streamlined workflow for algorithmic problem-solving.

## Key Features

- **Rigorous Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests are implemented for each challenge, ensuring solution correctness via `cargo test`.
- **Code Quality:** Adherence to Rust coding standards is maintained through `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` for formatting and linting.
- **Type Safety:** The Rust type system was instrumental in identifying and mitigating potential errors, particularly concerning integer overflows.
- **Library Utilization:** Established Rust crates, including `itertools` and `regex`, are leveraged for code conciseness and efficiency.
- **Performance Focus:** Complex data structure challenges were addressed with an emphasis on optimal Rust implementations.

## Performance Considerations

Particular attention was paid to performance, especially in challenges involving large datasets or complex algorithms. Benchmarking was used to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

I am satisfied with the resulting implementation and the insights gained from this process. I plan on continuing to solve more `Advent of Code` problems each year!
