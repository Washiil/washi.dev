# Welcome!

This is my personal website that contains my portfolio, contact, and blog. It's a project I created to better document my work and as a bonus learn `Next.js`.

## Tech Stack

Currently my tech stack is pretty limited as im just using Next.JS, TailwindCSS, and Turbopack. However, I am condifering adding some upvote systems, page view statistics, and analytics in the future.
