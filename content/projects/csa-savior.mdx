<h1>CSA-Savior Website</h1>

This project is a website built with SvelteKit and Svelte, designed to provide a streamlined and efficient user experience. It leverages the Svelte port of shadcn/ui for a modern and consistent component library. A key focus of this project was minimizing page reloads. Instead of full page refreshes, data is fetched directly from the GitHub API and the page is updated dynamically, resulting in a much snappier user experience. Basic SEO practices were implemented by adding `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`, even though they might be considered overkill for a small website.
