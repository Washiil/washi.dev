# CSA-Savior Website

This project is a website built with SvelteKit and Svelte, designed to provide a streamlined and efficient user experience. It leverages the Svelte port of shadcn/ui for a modern and consistent component library. A key focus of this project was minimizing page reloads. Instead of full page refreshes, data is fetched directly from the GitHub API and the page is updated dynamically, resulting in a much snappier user experience. Basic SEO practices were implemented by adding `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`, even though they might be considered overkill for a small website.

## The Stack

- **SvelteKit:** A framework for building web applications with Svelte.
- **Svelte:** A component-based JavaScript framework.
- **shadcn/ui (Svelte Port):** A collection of accessible and reusable components.
- **GitHub Pages:** For hosting the static website.
- **GitHub Actions:** For automated deployment.
- **npm:** For package management.
- **GitHub API:** For dynamic data fetching.

## Deployment

The website is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. This workflow simplifies the deployment process, ensuring that the site is always up-to-date with the latest changes.

## Future Plans

The future direction of this project is currently open. It's likely that this codebase will serve as a template for future projects related to note-taking and homework solutions as I continue my studies in computer science.

## Special Mentions

- **CodeHS:** For providing excellent free computer science classes.
- **Smashicons:** For the favicon.
