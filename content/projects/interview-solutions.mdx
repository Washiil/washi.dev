# LeetCode Solutions

This repository is a collection of my solutions to algorithmic and data structure problems from LeetCode and Codewars. It serves as a personal project to enhance coding skills, improve problem-solving abilities, and deepen my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

## Platforms

- **LeetCode:** A platform for practicing interview-style coding problems, offering a wide range of challenges to test algorithmic skills and data structure knowledge.
- **Codewars:** Focuses on Kata challenges, providing a platform to improve coding skills through various exercises. Solutions here range from 1kyu to 7kyu difficulty levels.

## Languages

- **Python:** Chosen for its versatility and widespread use in coding interviews, Python allows for rapid and efficient implementation of solutions.
- **Rust ðŸ¦€:** Selected for its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency, Rust enables the development of efficient and reliable algorithmic solutions. Using Rust after Python facilitates a deeper understanding of data structures and low-level concepts.
