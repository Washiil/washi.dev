<h1>CSA-Savior Website</h1>

This project is a website built with Next.js, typescript, and tailwind. It is designed to provide a streamlined and efficient user experience. Instead of full page refreshes, data is fetched directly from the GitHub API and the page is updated dynamically, resulting in a much snappier user experience. Basic SEO practices were implemented by adding `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`, even though they might be considered overkill for a small website.
