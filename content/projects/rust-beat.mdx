## Core Features

- **High Performance:** Utilizes atomic concurrency and multithreading for efficient processing and minimal latency.
- **Real-time Image Analysis:** Captures and analyzes the Roblox game window to determine note positions.
- **Automated Gameplay:** Simulates keyboard inputs to play the rhythm game accurately.
- **Dynamic Delay Adjustment:** Allows users to adjust the note delay in real-time for optimal synchronization.
- **Cross-Platform Window Capture:** Uses `xcap` crate to capture the Roblox game window.
- **Atomic Data Sharing:** Uses `Arc<AtomicU8>` and `Arc<AtomicU64>` for safe and efficient data sharing between threads.
- **Channel-Based Communication:** Uses `crossbeam::channel` for inter-thread communication.
- **Keyboard Simulation:** Uses `enigo` for simulating keyboard inputs.
- **Input Detection:** Uses `device_query` for detecting user input to adjust delay and stop the bot.

## Technical Implementation

The bot is implemented in Rust, emphasizing performance and concurrency. It consists of:

- **Producer Thread:** Captures the Roblox game window, analyzes the image data, and sends note information to consumer threads.
- **Consumer Threads:** Receive note information, calculate timing, and simulate keyboard inputs.
- **Atomic Data Structures:** Used for efficient and thread-safe data sharing.
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring:** Displays operations per second and delay information.

## Key Libraries

- **`device_query`:** For detecting keyboard inputs.
- **`enigo`:** For simulating keyboard inputs.
- **`parking_lot`:** For mutex and read-write lock implementations.
- **`std::sync::atomic`:** For atomic operations.
- **`xcap::Window`:** For capturing the Roblox game window.
